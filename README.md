# CloudConsole CLI (finna-cli)
A simple command line interface for CloudConsole.

### Building
To build the CLI, you will need to have Maven installed on your machine.
After you have Maven installed, you can run the following command to build the CLI:
```bash
mvn clean package
```
In the `target` directory, you will find a JAR file named `finna-cli.jar`. That is the final JAR file, which you can run.

### Usage
To use the CLI, you will need to have the JAR file built in the previous step or downloaded it from official releases.
After you have the JAR file, you can run the following command to see the usage:
```bash
java -jar finna-cli.jar help
```

### Simplicity
The CLI is designed to be simple and easy to use, giving you full control with minimal headaches. We've designed the CLI to be as user-friendly as possible, so you can focus on what matters most: your work.

### Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community. If you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or a pull request. We are always looking for ways to improve the CLI and make it better for everyone.
